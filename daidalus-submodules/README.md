DAIDAULUS Releases
---

To add a DAIDALUS release to DAA-Displays, clone under `daidalus-submodules` a repository containing the code of the release. By convention, the directory should be named v1.x.y or v2.x.y depending on whether it is a DAIDALUSv1 or DAIDALUSv2 release.  Add the name of the directory name to the file (`releases`)[releases].

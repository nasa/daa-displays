DAIDAULUS Releases
---

To add a DAIDALUS release to DAA-Displays, clone in `daidalus-submodules` a [DAIDALUS](https://github.com/nasa/daidalus.git) branch containing the code of the release. By convention, the directory of the cloned branch should be named `v1.x.y` or `v2.x.y` depending on whether it is a DAIDALUSv1 or DAIDALUSv2 release. Add the name of the directory to the file [`releases`](releases).

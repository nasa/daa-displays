# DAA-Displays: A Toolkit for the Analysis of Detect-And-Avoid Functions in Cockpit Displays
DAA-Displays is a toolkit for model-based design and analysis of software functions in cockpit
displays. It includes a library of interactive graphical display elements (widgets)
for cockpit systems, and simulations tools supporting comparative analysis of cockpit displays.

## Latest version
daa-displays-1.0.10

## Functionalities
- Library of interactive graphical display elements (called widgets) for cockpit systems: Compass, Interactive Map, Airspeed Tape, Altitude Tape, Vertical Speed, Virtual Horizon 
- Simulation tools supporting comparative analysis of cockpit displays

## Requirements
The following software is necessary to compile and execute DAA-Displays
- NodeJS (v14.16.1 or greater) https://nodejs.org/en/download
- Java Open JDK (1.9 or greater) https://openjdk.java.net/install
- C++ compiler (gcc version 7.4.0 for Linux, Apple clang 11.0.0 for MacOS)
- Google Chrome (80.0.x or greater) https://www.google.com/chrome

## Installation instructions
1. Download the latest release of DAA-Displays from the github repository.
2. Open a terminal window and change directory to the `daa-displays` folder.
3. Run `make` in the terminal window.
   This command will download the dependencies and create a folder `dist/` with the distribution.

## Use instructions
1. Open a terminal in the `daa-displays` folder, and run the bash script `./restart.sh` in the terminal window. The script will launch the daa-server on port 8082. *(Please keep the terminal window open otherwise the execution of the server will be terminated.)*
2. Open Google Chrome at http://localhost:8082
3. Launch one of the DAA Apps (`DANTi`, `single-view`, etc.) by clicking on the corresponding icon.
4. Select a flight scenario, a configuration, and a DAA specification using the drop-down menus provided by the App. Click `Load Selected Scenario and Configuration` to initialize the simulation.
5. Click `Play` to simulate the DAA specification in the selected flight scenario. Use the other simulation controls to jump to specific time instants, change the simulation speed, and generate plot diagrams.

## Tips for developers
The `./restart.sh` script supports the following options:
- `-help`                (Shows the available options)
- `-pvsio`               (Enables the pvsio process; pvsio must be in the execution path; requires nasalib)
- `-pvsio <path>`        (Enables the pvsio process; the given pvsio path is used for executing the pvsio environment; requires PVS and NASALib)
- `-fast`                (Enables optimizations, including caching of simulation results)
- `-port <port number>`  (The server will use the given port)

## Use Cases
The following examples illustrate concrete applications of the daa-displays toolkit for the analysis of DAA functions in cockpit displays.

### **Example 1**: Demonstration of a DAA algorithm
The rapid prototyping functionalities of the toolkit allow developers to create realistic simulations of cockpit displays suitable to demonstrate DAA specifications and implementations on concrete encounters.
The following example is for the analysis of maneuver guidance provided by a DAA algorithm
to help pilots resolve route conflicts in a flight scenario. 
Maneuver guidance has the form of *bands*, i.e., ranges
of heading, horizontal speed, vertical speed, and altitude maneuvers that
are predicted to be conflict free (the prediction is based on a mathematical 
formula that uses distance and time separation thresholds). Bands are color-coded: 
yellow denotes a corrective maneuver, red denotes a warning maneuver, and green
denotes a recovery maneuver.

The simulation shown in the figure below, illustrate a scenario where a traffic 
aircraft is overtaking the ownship.
Bands on the flight display indicate maneuvers that can be performed to avoid
the conflict. For example, yellow and red bands on the right side of the compass 
indicate that the ownship should avoid right turns.

To reproduce the demonstration shown in the figure:
1. Launch the `DANTi` app (see *Use instructions* above).
2. Select flight scenario `scenario_6` and click `Load Selected Scenario and Configuration`.
3. Click `Play` to watch the behavior of the DAA specification for the selected flight scenario.

### **Example 2**: Comparison of different DAA configurations
Split-view simulations facilitate the comparative analysis of 
two DAA implementations and formal specifications on the same encounter.
In the following example, a newer version of a DAA reference implementation
(on the left-hand side of the split-view) is compared with an older version. 
The newer version introduces additional maneuver guidance in the form of 
speed/heading/altitude bugs rendered on the flight display. 

![](screenshots/s_1_turn_L_wind_0_50.gif "")

To reproduce the demonstration shown in the figure:
1. Launch the `split-view` app (see *Use instructions* above).
2. Select flight scenario `s_1_turn_L_wind_0_50`, then select `WellClear-2.0.f.jar` on the left player and `WellClear-1.0.1.jar` in the right player. Click `Load Selected Scenario and Configuration`.
3. Click `Play` to watch the behavior of the two versions in the same flight scenario.

### **Example 3**: 3D Simulation
3D simulations move the focus of the analysis from a cockpit-centric 
view to a scenario-centric view that includes the wider airspace 
around the ownship. The viewport can be adjusted by tilting, 
panning, and zooming the view.  This capability
can be used to gain a better understanding of spatial information 
on the trajectories followed by the ownship and
traffic aircraft in a given scenario. This is useful, e.g., when
assessing DAA algorithms with computer-generated flight scenarios, as
this view provides a tangible idea of what the scenario is about.

The following example 3D simulation is used to examine 
the same flight scenario of Example 1, where a traffic aircraft overtakes the ownship.

![](screenshots/scenario_6_3d.gif "")

To reproduce the demonstration shown in the figure:
1. Launch the `3D view` app (see *Use instructions* above).
2. Select flight scenario `scenario_6` and click `Load Selected Scenario and Configuration`.
3. Click `Play` to watch the behavior of the DAA specification for the selected flight scenario. Position the mouse in the view and use mouse wheel to zoom in/out, use the central mouse button to tilt/pan the view.
